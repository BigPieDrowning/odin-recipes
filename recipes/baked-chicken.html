        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup prepared barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red wine</li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dry mustard powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together the barbecue sauce, soy sauce, red wine, maple syrup, chili powder, dry mustard powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and pour the sauce over the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces over in the sauce to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the baking dish, and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Pour the remaining sauce into a saucepan, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce; reduce heat to a simmer, and allow the sauce to thicken, whisking constantly. Return the chicken to the dish, and pour the thickened sauce over the chicken to serve.</li>
        </ol>
