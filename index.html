        <p>Hello and welcome, friends! This is my first major project, which I built entirely in HTML after learning its fundamentals from 
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">
                <em>The Odin Project</em>
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>This website contains recipes that I found on the internet and tested myself, and I can guarantee that they are superb, therefore I felt the need to share them with you in the hopes that you will enjoy them as well.</p>
        <h3>The Delicious Recipes I Found:</h3>
        <h4>Baked Chicken in a Sweet BBQ Sauce</h4>
        <p>The chicken is covered in a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce, then baked until perfectly juicy and caramelized.</p>
